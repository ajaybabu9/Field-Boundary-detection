# Field-Boundary-detection
Detecting field boundaries using hybrid filters which involves combing any two traditional filters that used for detecting boundaries
# Data collection
satellite images are the data set we have used.
# Data Preprocessing
building ground truth images for the data set,
Converting images into greyscale.
Then, perform normalization on image.
applying CLAHE(contrast limited adaptive histogram equilization)
# Data Analysis
building code for hybrid filters.
